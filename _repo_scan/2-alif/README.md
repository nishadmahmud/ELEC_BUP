# GridWise — LLM-Assisted Energy Optimization

BUP CSE Fest 2026 preliminary round submission. GridWise reads free-text
operator notes about a campus's energy day, uses an LLM to turn them into
structured directives, validates those directives deterministically, and
runs a linear-programming optimizer to produce a cost-minimal 24-hour grid
schedule.

```
notes + hourly data  ->  LLM Interpreter  ->  Guardrail Validator
                       ->  Optimizer (OR-Tools)  ->  Schedule Validator  ->  API response
```

The LLM's output is never trusted directly: every directive it proposes is
re-validated against a fixed schema before it can affect the schedule, and
every schedule the optimizer produces is replayed and re-checked before it
leaves the service. If the LLM is unreachable, misconfigured, or returns
something unparsable, the service falls back to treating every note as
`no_op` rather than failing the request.

## Architecture

1. **LLM Interpreter** (`app/services/interpreter.py`, prompt in
   `app/services/prompt.py`) — sends the operator notes plus battery
   capacity to an LLM in JSON mode, with a system prompt describing the six
   supported directive types, the hour-window convention (`[13, 14]` means
   1 PM–2 PM inclusive), and the solar-factor convention (`factor = 0.2`
   means usable solar is scaled to 20% of forecast). Calls retry with
   backoff up to `LLM_MAX_RETRIES` times; any failure (timeout, bad JSON,
   unreachable provider, missing API key) falls back to a safe `no_op`
   entry per note instead of raising.
2. **Guardrail Validator** (`app/services/directive_validator.py`,
   models in `app/schemas/directive.py`) — the LLM's raw output is treated
   as untrusted input. Each entry is checked against the exact schema for
   its `directive_type` (enum membership, hours ascending/unique/within
   0–23, `factor` in `[0, 1]`, the adjustment shape matching `applies`),
   deduplicated by `note_index`, and anything that fails validation is
   replaced with `no_op` rather than repaired or guessed at.
3. **Optimizer** (`app/services/optimizer.py`) — compiles the validated
   directives into per-hour numeric constraints
   (`app/services/constraints.py`) and solves a linear program with
   Google OR-Tools (GLOP): for each hour it picks `grid`, `solar_used`,
   `charge`, and `discharge` to satisfy the energy balance and battery
   transition equations while minimizing total grid cost, subject to
   battery capacity/rate limits, any LLM-derived charge/discharge/grid
   windows, and an end-of-day battery-neutrality constraint.
4. **Schedule Validator** (`app/services/schedule_validator.py`) — before
   any plan leaves the service, it is replayed hour-by-hour from scratch
   (energy balance, battery transition, capacity/rate limits, reserve
   minimums) using only the plan and the same compiled directive numbers
   the optimizer used. If replay finds a violation, the request fails with
   a controlled 500 instead of returning an invalid schedule.

A small read-only dashboard (`app/static/`, served at `/dashboard`) is
included for demoing scenarios in a browser. It calls the same
`/optimize-energy` endpoint a judge would and is not part of the judged
API contract.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- pip
- (Optional) Docker, for the container path below

## Quickstart (local, clean environment)

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the project
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd BUP_Hackathon

# 2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and set LLM_API_KEY (and LLM_BASE_URL / LLM_MODEL if not using
# OpenAI directly — see "Environment variables" below). The service still runs
# without an LLM key: every note is interpreted as no_op instead of failing.

# 4. Start the service
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# 5. Confirm it's up
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# {"status":"ok"}

# 6. Run one public sample case against /optimize-energy
python3 - <<'PY'
import json, urllib.request

with open("BUP_CSE_FEST_2026_Preli_Public_Sample_Cases.json") as f:
    case = json.load(f)["cases"][0]

req = urllib.request.Request(
    "http://localhost:8000/optimize-energy",
    data=json.dumps(case["input"]).encode(),
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    method="POST",
)
with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as resp:
    print(resp.status)
    print(json.dumps(json.load(resp), indent=2)[:1000])
PY
```

Equivalent one-liner with `curl` + `jq` if you prefer:

```bash
jq '.cases[0].input' BUP_CSE_FEST_2026_Preli_Public_Sample_Cases.json \
  | curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/optimize-energy \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- | jq .
```

## Environment variables

Set in `.env` (never commit this file — see [Secret handling](#secret-handling)).
Names only; no secret values below.

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `APP_NAME` | no | `GridWise Energy Optimizer` | Service name in logs |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `INFO` | Python logging level |
| `DEBUG` | no | `false` | Adds exception messages to 500 bodies. Keep `false` in deployment (Section 06.1 forbids exposing stack traces) |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | for LLM interpretation | *(empty)* | API key for the LLM provider. If unset, notes fall back to `no_op` instead of the request failing |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | for non-OpenAI providers | *(empty = OpenAI default)* | Base URL of an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint. This project runs against **Google Gemini** via its OpenAI-compatibility endpoint (`https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/`); leave blank to use OpenAI directly, or point at any other OpenAI-compatible provider (Groq, Together, etc.) |
| `LLM_MODEL` | no | `gpt-4o-mini` | Model name to request. We run `gemini-2.5-flash` against the Gemini endpoint above |
| `LLM_TEMPERATURE` | no | `0.0` | Sampling temperature (kept at 0 for deterministic directive extraction) |
| `LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | no | `20` | Per-attempt request timeout |
| `LLM_MAX_RETRIES` | no | `2` | Retry attempts on transient LLM failures before falling back to `no_op` |
| `SOLVER_TIME_LIMIT_SECONDS` | no | `10` | Time budget given to the OR-Tools LP solver per request |

Model/provider identifier: **Google Gemini `gemini-2.5-flash`, called through its
OpenAI-compatible API** (the OpenAI Python SDK is used unmodified, pointed at
Gemini's compatibility endpoint via `LLM_BASE_URL`). Any OpenAI-compatible
provider works by changing `LLM_BASE_URL` and `LLM_MODEL`.

## Running with Docker

```bash
docker build -t gridwise .
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env gridwise

curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

The container installs `requirements.txt`, copies the `app/` package and the
public sample-cases JSON (used only by the dashboard picker, not the judged
API), and starts `uvicorn` bound to `0.0.0.0` on `$PORT` (defaults to `8000`
if `$PORT` is not set, which covers hosts like Render/Railway/Fly that inject
their own port). No secrets are baked into the image — `LLM_API_KEY` must be
supplied at `docker run` time via `--env-file` or `-e`.

## API contract

### `GET /health`

Returns `200 {"status": "ok"}` once the service is ready to accept requests.

### `POST /optimize-energy`

Request body — one scenario object:

```json
{
  "scenario_id": "SAMPLE-01",
  "operator_notes": [
    "Facilities will wash the rooftop solar panels from noon until 2 PM. During cleaning, usable solar should be treated as roughly 25% of the forecast.",
    "The sports office moved next month's registration deadline."
  ],
  "hours": [
    { "hour": 0, "demand_kwh": 90, "solar_kwh": 0, "tariff_bdt_per_kwh": 6 },
    { "...": "24 entries total, one per hour 0-23" }
  ],
  "battery": {
    "capacity_kwh": 220,
    "initial_energy_kwh": 110,
    "minimum_energy_kwh": 40,
    "max_charge_kwh_per_hour": 50,
    "max_discharge_kwh_per_hour": 50
  }
}
```

Response body:

```json
{
  "scenario_id": "SAMPLE-01",
  "directive_interpretation": [
    {
      "note_index": 0,
      "applies": true,
      "directive_type": "solar_reduction",
      "structured_adjustment": { "hours": [12, 13], "factor": 0.25 },
      "explanation": "Panel cleaning reduces usable solar to 25% for hours 12-13."
    },
    { "note_index": 1, "applies": false, "directive_type": "no_op", "structured_adjustment": null, "explanation": "Irrelevant to energy scheduling." }
  ],
  "hourly_plan": [
    { "hour": 0, "grid_kwh": 12.5, "solar_used_kwh": 0.0, "battery_action": "idle", "battery_kwh": 0.0, "battery_energy_after_kwh": 110.0 },
    { "...": "24 entries total" }
  ],
  "total_grid_kwh": 0,
  "total_cost_bdt": 0,
  "peak_grid_kwh": 0,
  "plan_summary": "Applied 1 operator directive(s) to the 24-hour horizon and minimized grid cost subject to them, using available solar and battery flexibility while restoring the initial battery level by hour 23."
}
```

Error responses (never expose stack traces or secrets):

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `400` | Malformed JSON or a structurally invalid request (missing field, wrong type, wrong number of hours/notes) |
| `422` | Well-formed request that cannot describe a real system (e.g. `minimum_energy_kwh > capacity_kwh`, non-finite numbers) |
| `500` | Controlled internal error (e.g. the optimizer could not find a feasible schedule) |

Try it:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/optimize-energy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @sample_request.json
```

## Testing

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

The suite runs entirely offline: the LLM client is faked in
`tests/test_interpreter.py`, so no `LLM_API_KEY` or network access is
required to run tests. It covers the guardrail validator, the prompt shape,
the interpreter's retry/fallback behavior, and the optimizer/schedule
validator against known scenarios.

Lint (optional, not required to run the service):

```bash
ruff check .
```

## Known limitations

- If `LLM_API_KEY` is unset or the LLM call fails after `LLM_MAX_RETRIES`
  attempts, every operator note is interpreted as `no_op` — the optimizer
  still runs and returns a valid, cost-minimal schedule, just without any
  directive applied. This is a deliberate safety fallback, not a crash.
- The interpreter targets one LLM call per request covering all notes in
  that scenario (up to 3, per the request schema); it has been tested
  against Google Gemini's OpenAI-compatible endpoint and should work with
  any OpenAI-compatible provider, but only Gemini has been exercised in
  practice for this submission.
- The optimizer is a linear program (OR-Tools GLOP) with a small throughput
  penalty to break simultaneous charge/discharge ties; it assumes the
  battery model and directive constraints given are jointly feasible; a
  genuinely infeasible scenario (e.g. contradictory windows) surfaces as a
  controlled `500`, not a partial/invalid schedule.
- `LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `LLM_MAX_RETRIES` are configurable; with the
  defaults (`20s` timeout, `2` retries) a fully-exhausted retry path can
  approach the platform's request budget. If deploying somewhere with a
  strict end-to-end response deadline, consider lowering
  `LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and/or `LLM_MAX_RETRIES` in `.env`.
- The dashboard under `/dashboard` is a demo aid only; it is not part of
  the judged API contract and reads the same public sample pack this
  README uses for the reproduction test above.

## Secret handling

- Never commit `.env`, API keys, tokens, or passwords. `.env` is already
  listed in `.gitignore`; only `.env.example` (with empty/placeholder
  values) is committed.
- No secret values appear anywhere in this README — only environment
  variable *names*. Fill in real values locally in your own `.env`.
- The service never echoes secrets, raw prompts containing secrets, or
  stack traces in logs or API responses; `DEBUG=true` (local-only) adds an
  exception message to `500` bodies but never a key or token.
